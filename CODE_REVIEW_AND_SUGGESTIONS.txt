Summary of automated code review and fixes

Files checked:
- steam_collector.py
- fetch_monthly_prices.py
- requirements.txt

Fixes applied:
- fetch_monthly_prices.py: added `import os` at module level. Reason: `append_rows_to_csv` used `os.path.exists` but `os` was only imported locally inside `main()`, causing a NameError when `append_rows_to_csv` was called. The global import prevents this runtime error.
- requirements.txt: added `tqdm`. Reason: `steam_collector.py` imports `tqdm` but `requirements.txt` did not list it, causing import failures during runtime/import checks.

Runtime/static checks performed:
- Syntax checks: both Python files passed (no syntax errors).
- Import test: importing `fetch_monthly_prices` succeeded; importing `steam_collector` initially failed due to missing `tqdm` (now added to requirements).

Notes and recommendations (suggested features and improvements):
- Add a comprehensive `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`/`poetry`/`pipenv` manifest including: `requests`, `pandas`, `tqdm`. Consider adding exact versions for reproducibility.
- Add logging instead of print(): use Python `logging` to capture warnings/errors and control verbosity.
- Improve configuration: consider a CLI or a small config file (YAML/JSON) to set `MAX_APPS`, `REQUEST_DELAY`, file paths, and filtering options rather than editing constants in code.
- Make network calls more robust: add retries with exponential backoff (e.g., use `tenacity` or requests' `Session` with `urllib3.util.retry`).
- Unit tests: add basic tests for parsing and aggregation functions (e.g., `aggregate_monthly`, `parse_store_html_for_prices`) using sample inputs to prevent regressions.
- Rate limiting and parallelism: consider using an async approach (aiohttp) or a rate-limited worker pool for faster collection while respecting API limits.
- CSV handling: ensure header consistency across runs and add a manifest or a small README describing CSV column meanings. Consider using `pandas` to write/read if more complex transforms required.
- Error visibility: when skipping apps due to missing fields, optionally record these appIds to a separate CSV for later inspection.
- Output correctness: in `steam_collector.py` the final print states `Dataset saved to steam_games_dataset.csv` but the script actually writes several CSV files (`steam_metadata.csv`, etc.). Update the message to reflect actual outputs.
- Type hints and small refactors: add type hints to helper functions for clarity and easier static checking (mypy). Split large `main()` into smaller functions to improve testability.

Next steps I can take for you (pick any):
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in this environment and re-run import checks.
- Update `steam_collector.py` final print message to list all created files.
- Add logging and a small CLI to both scripts.
- Create basic unit tests for parsing/aggregation functions.

If you'd like, I can apply any of the above changes now.
